# PyLadies: Asteroids

This is my final project for Beginners course for PyLadies.

This project is a game similar to famous Asteroids, but my version is based on Stargate and Stargate Atlantis. Players rocket is Puddle jumper, the ship from Stargate Atlantis. Enemies are Wraiths, Ori and Goa'ulds ships. 

When players rocket crash with the enemy, players ship will disappear.

But the player has two weapons.
By pressing space key the ship will shoot by laser. If the laser hit the enemy ship, this ship will disappear. By pressing G key the ship will shoot by gummy bear. From the puddle jumper will fly out a small gummy bear and if it hits the enemy ship, this ship will slow down.
