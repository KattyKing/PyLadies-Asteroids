# PyLadies: Asteroids

This is my final project to Beginners course for PyLadies.

Final project should be a game like Asteroids. My version is this kind too, but it's based on Stargate and Stargate Atlantis. Players rocket is Puddle jumper, the ship from Stargate Atlantis. Enemies are Wraiths, Ori and Goa'ulds ships. 

When players rocket crash with enemies, players ship will disappear.

But player has two weapons.
By pressing space key will shoot by laser. If the laser hit enemie ship, this ship will disapear. By pressing G kez will shoot by gummy bear. From the puddle jumper will fly out a small gummy bear and if it hit the anemie ship, this ship will slow down.
