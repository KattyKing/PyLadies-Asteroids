# PyLadies: Asteroids

This is my final project for Beginners course for PyLadies.

Final project should be a game like Asteroids. My version is this kind too, but it's based on Stargate and Stargate Atlantis.
Players rocket is Puddle jumper, the ship from Stargate Atlantis. Anemies are Wraiths, Ori and Goa'ulds ships. 

When players rocket crash with anemies, players ship will disapear and the player fails.

But player has two weapons.
By pressing space key will shoot by laser. If the laser hit anemie ship, this ship will disapear.
By pressing G kez will shoot by gummybear. From the puddle jumper will fly out a small gummybear and if it hit the anemie ship,
this ship will slow down.
